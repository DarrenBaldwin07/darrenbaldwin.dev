# Clerk-rs v0.4.1 Release: Dependency Fix and Code Improvements

I'm excited to share the latest update to [clerk-rs](https://github.com/DarrenBaldwin07/clerk-rs), the official community-maintained Clerk SDK for Rust. Version 0.4.1 brings an important dependency fix and code quality improvements.

## What's New in v0.4.1

### Fixed: Missing Log Dependency

The primary focus of this release was resolving a critical dependency issue. The `log` crate was being used throughout the codebase for logging functionality, but wasn't properly declared as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`. This could lead to compilation issues for users depending on their dependency resolution.

**What was fixed:**
- Added `log = "0.4.27"` to the dependencies in `Cargo.toml`
- Ensures consistent logging functionality across all features
- Resolves potential compilation errors for users

### Code Quality Improvements

Along with the dependency fix, the entire codebase received a formatting pass:
- Applied consistent formatting using the project's rustfmt configuration
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Ensures consistent code style across all 260+ files in the project

## About Clerk-rs

For those new to clerk-rs, it's a comprehensive Rust SDK that provides:

- **Complete Clerk API Coverage**: Full support for all Clerk backend API operations
- **Web Framework Integration**: Built-in middleware for Actix Web, Axum, Rocket, and Poem
- **JWT Validation**: Robust session and token validation
- **Production Ready**: Used by companies like [Tembo](https://tembo.io), [Rezon](https://rezon.ai), and [Gitar](https://gitar.co)

## Quick Example

Here's how easy it is to get started with clerk-rs:

```rust
use tokio;
use clerk_rs::{clerk::Clerk, ClerkConfiguration, apis::emails_api::Email};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("sk_test_key".to_string()), None);
    let client = Clerk::new(config);

    Email::create(&client, Some(your_clerk_email));

    Ok(())
}
```

## Getting Started

To use the latest version in your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
clerk-rs = "0.4.1"
```

## Special Thanks

Big thanks to [@shogo-nakano-desu](https://github.com/shogo-nakano-desu) for identifying and fixing the dependency issue in [PR #117](https://github.com/DarrenBaldwin07/clerk-rs/pull/117).

## Looking Forward

This release demonstrates the community-driven nature of clerk-rs. As we continue to keep pace with Clerk's evolving API, community contributions like this one ensure the SDK remains reliable and up-to-date.

If you're building Rust applications that need authentication, give clerk-rs a try. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/DarrenBaldwin07/clerk-rs) for more examples and documentation.
