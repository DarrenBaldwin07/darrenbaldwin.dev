# clerk-rs: The Community-Maintained Clerk SDK for Rust

![Clerk + Rust](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarrenBaldwin07/clerk-rs/main/assets/clerk-rs.png)

## Introduction

[Clerk](https://clerk.com) has become one of the most popular authentication providers in the JavaScript ecosystem, providing a smooth developer experience and robust features for user management. While Clerk officially maintains SDKs for JavaScript, they don't have an official Rust SDK - until now! I'm excited to introduce **clerk-rs**, a community-maintained Rust SDK for Clerk's authentication API.

## What is clerk-rs?

clerk-rs is a comprehensive Rust SDK that provides full access to Clerk's backend API. It enables Rust developers to easily integrate Clerk's authentication and user management features into their applications.

Key features include:

- Complete implementation of Clerk's Backend API
- Support for multiple popular Rust web frameworks (Actix, Axum, Rocket, Poem)
- JWT validation middleware
- Type-safe API client
- Comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

To use clerk-rs in your Rust project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
clerk-rs = "0.4.1"
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of using clerk-rs to make API requests to Clerk:

```rust
use tokio;
use clerk_rs::{clerk::Clerk, ClerkConfiguration, endpoints::ClerkGetEndpoint};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("sk_test_key".to_string()), None);
    let client = Clerk::new(config);

    let res = client.get(ClerkGetEndpoint::GetUserList).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Framework Integration

One of the best features of clerk-rs is its seamless integration with popular Rust web frameworks. Here's how you can protect a route in Axum:

```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use clerk_rs::{
    clerk::Clerk,
    validators::{axum::ClerkLayer, jwks::MemoryCacheJwksProvider},
    ClerkConfiguration,
};

async fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello world!"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("your_secret_key".to_string()), None);
    let clerk = Clerk::new(config);

    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/index", get(index))
        .layer(ClerkLayer::new(MemoryCacheJwksProvider::new(clerk), None, true));

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").await?;
    axum::serve(listener, app).await
}
```

Similar middleware is available for Actix, Rocket, and Poem frameworks, making it easy to secure your API endpoints regardless of which framework you're using.

## Who's Using clerk-rs?

Several production applications are already using clerk-rs:

- [Tembo](https://tembo.io)
- [Rezon](https://rezon.ai)
- [Gitar](https://gitar.co)
- [Have I Been Squatted](https://haveibeensquatted.com)

## How to Contribute

clerk-rs is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome! The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DarrenBaldwin07/clerk-rs) where you can:
