# Clerk-rs: The Official Community Rust SDK for Clerk

Clerk-rs is a comprehensive, community-maintained Rust SDK that provides seamless integration with the [Clerk](https://clerk.com) authentication platform. As the official Rust binding for Clerk's Backend API, it enables developers to add robust authentication and user management capabilities to their Rust applications.

## What is Clerk-rs?

Clerk-rs is a fully-featured SDK that bridges the gap between Rust applications and Clerk's powerful authentication services. It provides both low-level API access and high-level middleware integrations for popular Rust web frameworks, making it easy to implement authentication in any Rust-based application.

## Key Features

### üîå **Complete API Coverage**
- Full coverage of Clerk's Backend API with auto-generated models and endpoints
- Support for all CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Dynamic endpoint support with parameterized requests
- Comprehensive user, session, and organization management

### üõ°Ô∏è **Multi-Framework Middleware Support**
Built-in authentication middleware for major Rust web frameworks:
- **Actix-web**: Full middleware support with JWT validation
- **Axum**: Layer-based authentication middleware
- **Rocket**: Guard-based authentication system
- **Poem**: Middleware support for Poem v3

### üîê **Advanced Security Features**
- JWT token validation and verification
- JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) provider with memory caching
- Session cookie validation for same-origin requests
- Automatic token refresh and management

### üì° **HTTP Client Integration**
- Built on `reqwest` for reliable HTTP communication
- Support for both native-TLS and rustls-tls
- Async/await support throughout the API
- Comprehensive error handling

## Architecture Overview

The SDK is organized into several key modules:

- **`apis/`**: Auto-generated API clients for all Clerk endpoints
- **`models/`**: Strongly-typed data models for Clerk entities
- **`validators/`**: Framework-specific middleware and authentication guards
- **`endpoints/`**: Endpoint definitions and routing
- **`clerk.rs`**: Core client implementation

## Usage Examples

### Basic API Client
```rust
use clerk_rs::{clerk::Clerk, ClerkConfiguration, endpoints::ClerkGetEndpoint};

let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("sk_test_key".to_string()), None);
let client = Clerk::new(config);
let users = client.get(ClerkGetEndpoint::GetUserList).await?;
```

### Axum Middleware Integration
```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use clerk_rs::{
    clerk::Clerk,
    validators::{axum::ClerkLayer, jwks::MemoryCacheJwksProvider},
    ClerkConfiguration,
};

let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("your_secret_key".to_string()), None);
let clerk = Clerk::new(config);

let app = Router::new()
    .route("/protected", get(protected_handler))
    .layer(ClerkLayer::new(MemoryCacheJwksProvider::new(clerk), None, true));
```

## Production Ready

Clerk-rs is actively used in production by several companies including:
- [Tembo](https://tembo.io) - PostgreSQL cloud platform

- **Serialization**: Serde with derive support

## Why Choose Clerk-rs?

1. **Official Community Support**: Maintained as the official Rust SDK for Clerk
2. **Framework Agnostic**: Works with all major Rust web frameworks
3. **Type Safety**: Fully typed API with compile-time guarantees
4. **Performance**: Built with Rust's zero-cost abstractions
5. **Production Tested**: Used by real companies in production environments
6. **Active Development**: Regularly updated to match Clerk API changes

## Getting Started

Add clerk-rs to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
clerk-rs = "0.4.1"

# Enable framework-specific features as needed
clerk-rs = { version = "0.4.1", features = ["axum"] }
```

The SDK provides comprehensive examples for each supported framework in the `/examples` directory, making it easy to get started with your preferred Rust web framework.
