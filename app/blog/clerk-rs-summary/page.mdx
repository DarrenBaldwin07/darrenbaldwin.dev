# clerk-rs: The Official Community Rust SDK for Clerk

## Summary

**clerk-rs** is a comprehensive Rust SDK that provides seamless integration with [Clerk](https://clerk.com), a popular authentication and user management platform. This community-maintained library enables Rust developers to easily implement authentication, user management, and session handling in their applications.

## What clerk-rs Does

clerk-rs serves as a bridge between Rust applications and Clerk's authentication services, offering:

### Core Functionality
- **Complete API Coverage**: Full access to Clerk's Backend API with support for all CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- **User Management**: Create, update, delete, and manage users programmatically
- **Session Handling**: Validate and manage user sessions with JWT token verification
- **Organization Management**: Handle organizations, memberships, and invitations
- **Authentication Flows**: Support for sign-up, sign-in, and various authentication methods

### Web Framework Integration
clerk-rs provides middleware and guards for popular Rust web frameworks:

- **Actix Web**: Middleware for protecting routes with authentication
- **Axum**: Layer-based authentication with JWT extraction
- **Rocket**: Guard-based authentication system
- **Poem**: Middleware support with route exclusion capabilities

### Key Features
- **JWT Validation**: Built-in JWT token verification using JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)
- **Cookie Support**: Session cookie validation for same-origin requests
- **Memory Caching**: Efficient JWKS caching with `MemoryCacheJwksProvider`
- **Async/Await**: Full async support with Tokio runtime compatibility
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed models and request/response structures
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper Rust error types

## Architecture

The SDK is organized into several key modules:

- **`apis/`**: Contains all API endpoint implementations organized by functionality
- **`models/`**: Rust structs representing Clerk's data models (User, Organization, Session, etc.)
- **`validators/`**: Framework-specific middleware and authentication validators
- **`clerk.rs`**: Core client implementation with HTTP methods
- **`endpoints.rs`**: Endpoint definitions and URL path management

## Production Usage

clerk-rs is actively used in production by several companies including:
- [Tembo](https://tembo.io) - Cloud Postgres platform
- [Rezon](https://rezon.ai) - AI platform
- [Gitar](https://gitar.co) - Development tool
- [Have I Been Squatted](https://haveibeensquatted.com) - Security service

## Example Use Cases

### Basic API Usage
```rust
use clerk_rs::{clerk::Clerk, ClerkConfiguration, endpoints::ClerkGetEndpoint};

let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("sk_test_key".to_string()), None);
let client = Clerk::new(config);
let users = client.get(ClerkGetEndpoint::GetUserList).await?;
```

### Route Protection with Axum
```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use clerk_rs::{
    clerk::Clerk,
    validators::{axum::ClerkLayer, jwks::MemoryCacheJwksProvider},
    ClerkConfiguration,
};

let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("your_secret_key".to_string()), None);
let clerk = Clerk::new(config);

let app = Router::new()
    .route("/protected", get(protected_handler))
    .layer(ClerkLayer::new(MemoryCacheJwksProvider::new(clerk), None, true));
```

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: Rust (Edition 2021)
- **License**: MIT
- **HTTP Client**: reqwest (with optional native-tls or rustls-tls)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio compatible
- **Serialization**: serde with JSON support
- **JWT Handling**: jsonwebtoken crate for token verification

## Why Use clerk-rs?

1. **Community Maintained**: Actively developed and maintained by the Rust community
2. **Production Ready**: Used by multiple companies in production environments
3. **Framework Agnostic**: Works with multiple web frameworks or standalone
4. **Type Safe**: Leverages Rust's type system for compile-time safety
5. **Performance**: Efficient async implementation with memory caching
6. **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects of Clerk's API and authentication flows

clerk-rs makes it easy for Rust developers to integrate robust authentication and user management into their applications without having to implement these complex features from scratch.
