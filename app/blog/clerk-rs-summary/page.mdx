# Clerk-rs: The Official Community Rust SDK for Clerk Authentication

## Overview

**clerk-rs** is the official community-maintained Rust SDK for [Clerk](https://clerk.com), a comprehensive authentication and user management platform. This library provides Rust developers with a robust, type-safe interface to integrate Clerk's authentication services into their applications.

## What is clerk-rs?

clerk-rs is a comprehensive Rust client library that enables developers to:

- **Authenticate users** through Clerk's authentication system
- **Manage user accounts** programmatically via the Clerk Backend API
- **Protect API endpoints** with JWT validation and session management
- **Integrate seamlessly** with popular Rust web frameworks like Actix-web, Axum, Rocket, and Poem

## Key Features

### üîê Complete Authentication Solution
- JWT token validation and verification
- Session cookie validation for same-origin requests
- JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) caching for performance
- Support for multiple authentication methods

### üåê Framework Integration
The SDK provides middleware and guards for popular Rust web frameworks:
- **Actix-web**: `ClerkMiddleware` for route protection
- **Axum**: `ClerkLayer` for application-wide authentication
- **Rocket**: `ClerkGuard` for request guards
- **Poem**: `ClerkPoemMiddleware` for endpoint protection

### üì° Full API Coverage
Complete bindings for the Clerk Backend API including:
- User management (create, update, delete users)
- Organization management
- Session handling
- Email and SMS operations
- JWT template management
- Webhook validation

### üîß Developer Experience
- **Type-safe**: All API responses and requests are strongly typed
- **Async/await**: Built on modern async Rust patterns
- **Comprehensive examples**: Ready-to-use examples for each supported framework
- **Well-documented**: Extensive documentation and API reference

## Use Cases

clerk-rs is perfect for:

- **Web APIs** that need user authentication and authorization
- **Microservices** requiring centralized user management
- **SaaS applications** with multi-tenant architecture
- **Backend services** that integrate with Clerk-powered frontend applications
- **Enterprise applications** requiring robust authentication flows

## Architecture

The library is structured into several key modules:

- **`apis/`**: Generated API client bindings for all Clerk endpoints
- **`models/`**: Strongly-typed data structures for API requests/responses
- **`validators/`**: Framework-specific middleware for authentication
- **`clerk.rs`**: Core client implementation with HTTP methods
- **`endpoints.rs`**: Enum definitions for all available API endpoints

## Production Ready

clerk-rs is actively used in production by several companies including:
- [Tembo](https://tembo.io) - Database as a Service platform
- [Rezon](https://rezon.ai) - AI-powered applications
- [Gitar](https://gitar.co) - Developer productivity tools
- [Have I Been Squatted](https://haveibeensquatted.com) - Domain security service

## Getting Started

```rust
use clerk_rs::{clerk::Clerk, ClerkConfiguration};

// Initialize the client
let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(
    None, 
    None, 
    Some("sk_test_your_secret_key".to_string()), 
    None
);
let client = Clerk::new(config);

// Make API calls
let users = client.get(ClerkGetEndpoint::GetUserList).await?;
```

## Why clerk-rs?

- **Community-driven**: Actively maintained by the Rust community
- **Up-to-date**: Regularly updated to match the latest Clerk API
- **Performance-focused**: Built with Rust's performance and safety in mind
- **Framework-agnostic**: Works with any Rust web framework
- **Enterprise-ready**: Used in production by multiple companies

clerk-rs bridges the gap between Clerk's powerful authentication platform and the Rust ecosystem, providing developers with the tools they need to build secure, scalable applications with confidence.
