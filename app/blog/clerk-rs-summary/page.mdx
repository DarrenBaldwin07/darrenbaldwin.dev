# Clerk-rs: The Official Community Rust SDK for Clerk

## Overview

Clerk-rs is a comprehensive, community-maintained Rust SDK that provides seamless integration with the Clerk authentication and user management platform. As the official Rust implementation of Clerk's backend API, it enables Rust developers to easily incorporate modern authentication, user management, and organization features into their applications.

## What is Clerk-rs?

Clerk-rs is a production-ready SDK that wraps Clerk's REST API in idiomatic Rust code. It provides type-safe interfaces for all Clerk operations, making it easy to manage users, sessions, organizations, and authentication flows in Rust applications. The SDK is actively maintained and frequently updated to stay in sync with Clerk's evolving API.

## Architecture

The SDK is structured around several core modules:

- **APIs**: Complete coverage of Clerk's REST endpoints
- **Models**: Type-safe data structures for all Clerk entities
- **Validators**: Authentication middleware for web frameworks
- **Configuration**: Flexible setup for different environments
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for common operations

## Usage Examples

### Basic User Management
```rust
use clerk_rs::{clerk::Clerk, ClerkConfiguration, apis::users_api::User};

let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("sk_test_key".to_string()), None);
let client = Clerk::new(config);

// Get user list
let users = User::get_user_list(&client, None, None, None, None, None, None).await?;
```

### Framework Integration (Axum)
```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use clerk_rs::{
    clerk::Clerk,
    validators::{axum::ClerkLayer, jwks::MemoryCacheJwksProvider},
    ClerkConfiguration,
};

let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(None, None, Some("your_secret_key".to_string()), None);
let clerk = Clerk::new(config);

let app = Router::new()
    .route("/protected", get(protected_handler))
    .layer(ClerkLayer::new(MemoryCacheJwksProvider::new(clerk), None, true));
```

## Production Usage

Clerk-rs is trusted by several production applications:

- **[Tembo](https://tembo.io)** - Postgres platform

- **[Have I Been Squatted](https://haveibeensquatted.com)** - Security service

## API Coverage

The SDK provides complete coverage of Clerk's backend API, including:

- **User Management**: CRUD operations, authentication, metadata
- **Session Management**: Creation, verification, revocation
- **Organization Management**: Complete org lifecycle
- **Email/SMS**: Template management and messaging
- **Webhooks**: Svix integration for event handling
- **JWT Templates**: Custom token generation
- **Instance Settings**: Configuration management
- **Allow/Block Lists**: Access control management

## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
clerk-rs = "0.4.1"

# Optional features for web framework integration
clerk-rs = { version = "0.4.1", features = ["actix"] }
clerk-rs = { version = "0.4.1", features = ["axum"] }
clerk-rs = { version = "0.4.1", features = ["rocket"] }
clerk-rs = { version = "0.4.1", features = ["poem"] }
```

## Why Choose Clerk-rs?
