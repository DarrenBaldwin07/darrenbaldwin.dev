# clerk-rs Gets Enhanced Logging Support

The [clerk-rs](https://github.com/DarrenBaldwin07/clerk-rs) SDK, the official community-maintained Rust SDK for Clerk authentication, has received an important update that enhances its logging capabilities. This update improves debugging and monitoring for developers using Clerk in their Rust applications.

## What's New

The latest update (commit `a3f4219`) introduces the `log` crate as a direct dependency to the clerk-rs SDK. This change ensures that logging functionality is properly integrated throughout the SDK, making it easier for developers to debug authentication flows and monitor SDK behavior.

### Key Changes

- **Added `log` dependency**: The SDK now includes the `log` crate (version 0.4.27) as a direct dependency
- **Improved debugging**: Better logging support for troubleshooting authentication issues
- **Enhanced monitoring**: Easier tracking of SDK operations in production environments

## Why This Matters

Previously, developers might have encountered situations where the SDK's internal logging wasn't properly configured or available. This update ensures that:

1. **Consistent Logging**: All SDK operations can now emit proper log messages
2. **Better Debugging**: Developers can more easily diagnose authentication issues
3. **Production Monitoring**: Better visibility into SDK behavior in production environments

## How to Use

The logging functionality works with any Rust logging framework that's compatible with the `log` crate, such as `env_logger`, `tracing`, or `log4rs`. Here's a simple example:

```rust
use clerk_rs::{clerk::Clerk, ClerkConfiguration};
use env_logger;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize logging
    env_logger::init();
    
    let config = ClerkConfiguration::new(
        None, 
        None, 
        Some("sk_test_your_key_here".to_string()), 
        None
    );
    let client = Clerk::new(config);
    
    // SDK operations will now emit log messages
    let users = client.get_user_list(None, None, None, None, None, None).await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## About clerk-rs

clerk-rs is the official community-maintained Rust SDK for [Clerk](https://clerk.com), providing comprehensive authentication and user management features for Rust applications. The SDK supports multiple web frameworks including:

- **Actix Web**: Full middleware support for protecting routes
- **Axum**: Layer-based authentication integration
- **Rocket**: Guard-based route protection
- **Poem**: Middleware support for authentication

## Production Users

The SDK is trusted by several production applications including:
- [Tembo](https://tembo.io) - Database platform
- [Rezon](https://rezon.ai) - AI platform
- [Gitar](https://gitar.co) - Development tools
- [Have I Been Squatted](https://haveibeensquatted.com) - Security service

## Get Started

To start using clerk-rs with the enhanced logging support, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
clerk-rs = "0.4.1"
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.10" # or your preferred logging implementation
```
